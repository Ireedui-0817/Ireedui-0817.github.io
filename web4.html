     <p>My name is Bat-Ireedui and I am 17 years old. 
         I couldn't go to kindergarten because I broke my hand, went to elemantary school in 2009. 
         I was awarded the most talented student in my elementary school. 
         During middle school I started enjoying English so much and made a plan to study abroad.
        Since I had a dream to study abroad I have been learning English since 2015. 
        I graduated my middle school in 2017 by achieving the best valedictorian. I also liked public speaking.</p>
